	    <div><h1>2017/01/01 - Do It Yourself: an artificial intelligence</h1>
<p>The main goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to translate human
knowledge into equations.</p>
<p>The problem that arise and still holds is that it can't be solved on a
human time scale with current technology.</p>
<p>The problem must be reduced to a problem that can be solved under time
constraints pratical for mortals.</p>
<p>Machine learning produce projections of human knowledge over a smaller
number of dimensions to make the computation pratical and sometime
infer knowledge about how the results was done.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to put order in the mix, my idea is to increase the
entropy of knowledge graph using grounded topologies.</p>
<p>Building such structure can be done though personnal note taking
applications, croudsource applications and puzzle games.</p>
<p>Not only we leverage Human knowledge and computation skills but append
to the already mastered ways of the intelligencewith improved logical
and fuzzy reasoning but also push further the use of pattern matching
cognition skills that the brain already has.</p>
<p>The opportunities to create cogni-games are manyfolds. People with
disabilities can be offered new ways to interact with the world in a
meaningful and enjoyable way.</p>
<p>cogni-art and cogni-game are really what should.be+is all about
anthroposcene.</p>
